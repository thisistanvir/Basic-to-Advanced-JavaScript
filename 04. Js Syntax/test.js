/**
 * JavaScript Syntax
 *
 * JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:
 */
// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;

/**
 * JavaScript Values
 *
 * The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
 * Fixed values
 * Variable values
 *
 * Fixed values are called Literals.
 * Variable values are called Variables.
 */
//  JavaScript Literals
// 1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:
10.5;

1001;

// 2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
("John Doe");

("John Doe");

// JavaScript Variables
// In a programming language, variables are used to store data values.
// JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
// An equal sign is used to assign values to variables.
// In this example, x is defined as a variable. Then, x is assigned (given) the value 6:
let x;
x = 6;

/**
 * JavaScript Operators
 *
 * JavaScript uses arithmetic operators ( + - * / ) to compute values:
 * JavaScript uses an assignment operator ( = ) to assign values to variables:
 */
(5 + 6) * 10;

let x, y;
x = 5;
y = 6;

/**
 * JavaScript Expressions
 *
 * An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
 * The computation is called an evaluation.
 * For example, 5 * 10 evaluates to 50:
 */
5 * 10;

//  Expressions can also contain variable values:
x * 10;

/**
 * JavaScript Keywords
 *
 * JavaScript keywords are used to identify actions to be performed.
 *
 * The let keyword tells the browser to create variables:
 */
let x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;

// The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables:
var x, y;
x = 5 + 6;
y = x * 10;

/**
 * JavaScript Comments
 *
 * Not all JavaScript statements are "executed".
 * Code after double slashes // or between /* and *\/ is treated as a comment.
 * Comments are ignored, and will not be executed:
 */
let x = 5; // I will be executed

// x = 6;   I will NOT be executed
